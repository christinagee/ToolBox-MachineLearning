1) What is the general trend in the curve?
We see that the general trend of the curve is that accuracy increases as
data percentage increases.

2) Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others? Why?
After running the the graph several time, the general trend shows that there
is more noise in the bottom right hand corner of the graph where the accuracy varies
and the percentage of data used is quite low. This is probably because there
are several outliers that skew the data when the data set is smaller, where as
when the percentage of data used for training increases then the training data
becomes pretty standardized and not easily skewed by an outlier.

3) How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
After 1000 trials there is a smooth curve.

4) Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10** -10)).
What happens? If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as
well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.
Larger values of C seem to make the curve noisier while lower values seem to make it less noisy.
